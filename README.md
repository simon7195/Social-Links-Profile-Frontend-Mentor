## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I didn't had Figma files for this project, so I only worked with designs in .jpeg format. I used Photoshop to quickly calculate the dimensions in pixels (unfortunately it's much more approximate than with Figma). ðŸ˜ª

### Useful resources

- [CSS custom properties (variables)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) - I really love this CSS feature, it didn't exist when I learned css. Useful !
- [CSS Reset](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) - For a better CSS start.
